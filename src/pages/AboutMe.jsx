          <p>
            I'm a Full Stack Developer, passionate about
            blending artistic design and technology to build clean, modern, and
            intuitive web applications. I love creating responsive, accessible
            interfaces that elevate user experiences and bring ideas to life
            through thoughtful design and efficient code.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Proficient across the full development stack, I also enjoy building
            APIs, optimizing performance, and deploying scalable solutions. I'm
            highly skilled in leveraging AI-assisted development tools and
            emerging technologies to increase efficiency, enhance product
            quality, and contribute to high-performing, forward-thinking teams.
