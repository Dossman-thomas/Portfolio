          <p>
          Hello there! I'm Tom! I’m a passionate Full Stack Developer with a keen eye for frontend magic. My love for art and design fuels my creativity, making the frontend my canvas to craft seamless and visually clean user experiences.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Beyond UX/UI, I'm also intrigued by the backend—how APIs and databases rule the web, plus how it all interfaces with the frontend!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Constantly hungry for knowledge, web development has become my playground, a realm I once took for granted but now embrace for its depth and intricacies.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          When not in front of the screen, I trade code for the therapeutic outdoors via hiking, gardening, snowboarding, and windsurfing. I also love to mix it up on the ice (hockey) and passionately root for the Philadelphia Flyers!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of technology and creativity!
